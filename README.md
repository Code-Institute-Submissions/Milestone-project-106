#Milestone Project 2 - Refueling with LNG

##Aim of the project
Truck Refueling website was designed to give a comprehensive overview of Shell and third party LNG providers in Europe. Third party LNG providers are - Rolande, Avia, Airliquide. 
The main goals of the website are:
1.	give the latest overview of all Shell and third party LNG refueling stations,
2.	have correct locations of the stations,
3.	enable drivers to plan their journey,
4.	indicate where the customer card is accepted. 

###Background
There are not many LNG refueling stations, which makes it important to plan a journey well, so that the truck can be refueled on the way from A to B. 
Also, LNG stations are not represented correctly on Google map, which makes it difficult for drivers to find a station. 
Next, not all LNG stations in Europe accept Shell LNG card.

If logistic company chooses Shell as LNG provider, the drivers of this company receive a Shell LNG card with which they can pay for refueling at a certain discount. 
As Shell has a partnership with Rolande, Avia, Airliquide, drivers can refuel at this stations at a certain discount as well. 
It is important for site owners and site users to have the most updated view on the location of the stations. 
The owners can benefit from the volumes sold at the stations promoted by this website. 
The users can benefit form the discounts given by the Shell LNG card and can plan their journey better.
