Deployment – Live Website

Create repository in GitHub and give it a relevant name.
Click on your repository to open it.
Find the “settings” tab and click on it.
Scroll down until you arrive at the “GitHub Pages” sections.
Under the “source” drop down menu, choose a branch. I chose “master branch” and select it.
You will then see a URL to your live webpage. In my case the URL is https://elena-pakhmurskaia.github.io/Milestone_1/index.html
Deployment – Run Locally

click on the repository called Elena-Pakhmurskaia/Milestone_1.
Along the top bar, find the “clone or download” button.
Here you have the option to clone by HTTPS or SSH.
Once you have chose your desired option, then click the copy icon next to the URL.
Open Git Bash.
Ensure you are in the correct directory which you want to copy the code into. If not, change the directory now.
In the terminal, write the $ git clone https://elena-pakhmurskaia.github.io/Milestone_1/index.html
Press the enter button and your clone will be created.
